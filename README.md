# Summary

Dev server, typed webpack config, typescript, jsx, babel.

No SASS/SCSS/LESS. No static files. Wiring those in are highly dependent on integration.

# Usage

```bash
npm install  # install packages

npm run start  # launch + hot reloading + watch file changes http://localhost:3099

npm run build  # build to dist/
```

## Environmental variables

[Webpack's environmental variables] can be passed (`--env`):

`npm run start -- --env.devServerPort 3082`, build + watch at <http://localhost:3082>

`npm run start -- --env.production`

`npm run start -- --open` Launch browser + build + watch files, <http://localhost:3099>

[webpack's environmental variables]: https://webpack.js.org/guides/environment-variables/

# Weakness of most starters (e.g. create-react-app):

- Opaque: No way to see the innards of what's being built

     Even `npm run eject` shows tons of macro code that resembles nothing like what a webpack config
     would look like on a project.

- Labyrinthian: Tons of stuff to remove, overlapping dependencies. Many things of which aren't
  being used.

     _package.json_ riddled with stuff you don't even know they're for.

     You'll then go out and find starters in github repos to find they add tons of specialized stuff
     that wouldn't fit your unique integration. You don't want jest, or wouldn't integrate it they
     way they do.

     Same thing. _package.json_ is like Windows' _services.msc_ - everything sounds important, but
     you're probably not using half of them.

     You're really not much better off than you were with an ejected `create-react-app`. It's
     faster to just start anew and add what you want.

     But a scratch project with webpack and react is actually hard:

     Webpack, ts-loader, babel, webpack-dev-server, so on. There's so many projects to synthesize
     and all their usages every 3 months. You have to drop by each project, see the minimal example,
     and hope they fit and you can get a _basic build_

That's all this is.
